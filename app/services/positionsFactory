As market-leading providers of products and services to Fortune 1000 companies, many of the companies have leveraged Platinum's technological expertise and resources to pioneer innovations within their industries.\n\nThe majority of the Company's client lineup is the result of privately-funded acquisitions made with blue chip corporations including Motorola, Alcatel, Lucent, Fujitsu and Philips. Since its founding in 1995, Platinum Equity's expansion has been fueled by the organic growth and value creation realized within each operation, as well as strategic acquisitions that provide additional customers, employees and services in synergistic sectors of the technology market.\n\nPlatinum Equity executes seamless transactions with a customer-focused, employee-committed philosophy, providing management expertise, strategic direction and leadership in the technology marketplace.\n\nThe Company was listed #44 in the 2002 Forbes Largest Private Companies list (up from #75 in 2001 and #326 in 2000).\n\nDifferentiating Business Practices:  Platinum Equity invests in companies and businesses that it understands, playing a strategic role in lending financial and high-level management resources and expertise to help each company grow. \n\nThe Company takes a  managed entrepreneurship  approach with each of its acquisitions.

The Bradmore Group performs real estate advisory functions, asset management and property management for a group of over 25 companies which invest in real estate and marketable securities. Our success is attributable to the dedication of John M. Bohn, President of the Bradmore Group, and his team, who are committed to serving its investors and tenants with the utmost professionalism and integrity. It is through this philosophy that we keep vacancy rates low and return on investment strong.   Real Estate Advisory | Asset & Property Management The Bradmore Group companies consist of limited partnerships, LLC’s, corporations, trusts and recently increased our portfolio with a Tenant In Common (TIC) arrangement to invest in occupied real estate.  Our investments largely consist of industrial real estate located in California. We do, however also own some creative office space as well as retail properties. We pride ourselves in acquiring properties that we plan to hold as long-term investments. Furthermore, our senior executives typically personally invest in each of the properties we manage. Based upon our need to manage our own assets, we have developed three distinct areas of expertise in order to maximize our profitability; Real Estate Advisory, Asset Management and Property Management.  Real Estate Advisory functions are necessary so that we properly manage the global requirements for maintaining high returns on investment for our investors along with the obligations associated with managing the various legal entities which own the investments. This area also focuses on strategic management decisions regarding growth opportunities of acquisitions and development along with procuring debt to leverage the growth. Historically we have maintained a very low debt profile for our growth model. This strategy has served us well with various economic climates and our partners have benefited from this conservative slow and steady growth model.  We focus efforts toward maximizing our overall profitability on the assets we manage. These efforts include maintaining high occupancies for our leased investments along with minimizing any unnecessary expenses. Our philosophy is to preventatively maintain our buildings and to quickly respond to our tenants if any issues arise. Our success is measured by our historically low vacancy rate of less than 2% over our many years of operating. Our income stream is also preserved through expedient and aggressive leasing efforts and by cultivating long-term loyal relationship with our leasing brokers. We preserve good relationships with our tenants and review their payment performance on a weekly basis. We minimize collection efforts by analyzing income frequently. We are rigorous in preparing financial reporting and tax preparation in a timely fashion. We forecast each of our companies financial performance over a five-year time frame so that we can anticipate extra-ordinary events that may affect our overall profitability.  Property Management includes some of our more routine day-to-day functions that are critical to our operation. These areas include lease administration, property inspection, and on-site management for specific property locations. We oversee tenant improvement construction requirements, tenant turnover activity, along with accurate monthly billing and rent collection. Our success with property development and management is attributed to maintaining rewarding relationships with tenants, brokers, and other professionals necessary to maintain our overall financial success.

A senior consultant works in a project oriented environment and is assigned to specific client projects with an agreed upon (contracted/negotiated) set of project deliverables, timeline, and fee arrangement. Projects vary in nature and in size and complexity, running from a few weeks in duration to multiple years in duration. Most assignments are three to six months in duration on average. Projects are performed on the client premises and can either be performed as an individual serving the client or as a team of consultants meeting the needs of the client. All projects require senior consultants to have access and utilize proprietary, confidential, strategic and sensitive information of both the client and the employer. That information includes both physical and intellectual property. All assignments require that an employee maintain confidentiality and professional standards set by our clients and agreed to through our project contracts.Senior consultant assignments vary depending the nature of the client's needs and require an individual to work across various functional business areas of a utility including generation, transmission, distribution, power procurement, customer service, accounting and finance, information technology, regulatory affairs, procurement and warehousing and other organizational areas. Senior consultants are required to understand the clients' business challenges, create approaches to solve the challenges, and implement solutions agreed to with the clients. Senior consultants obtain information, assimilate information, identify alternative solutions, provide recommended solutions and work with clients to determine the best options for their business needs. They are also expected to conduct interviews and meet with clients at all levels of an organization, including staff, managers, executives and officers. They are hired to solve specific problems and are expected to operate in a stressful and highly challenging environment. Senior consultants are also expected to manage and supervise other consultants on projects. The level of supervision will vary with the complexity and difficulty of the assignment. Senior consultants are expected to work long hours including weekends and holidays, as necessary, in order to support the demanding client needs. Often, senior consultants are assigned to improve business processes in which they have little or no prior experience or expertise.

We evaluate each investment carefully with a value-based focus. Our independent group of senior investment professionals is decisive and responsive to market needs. Post-closing, we take a consultative approach by sharing related experiences and providing additional capital, if needed, to assist our portfolio companies in achieving growth objectives and long-term value.
